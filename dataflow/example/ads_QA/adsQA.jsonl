For answers to that question, we launched a Gamification campaign that had a funny character called \"Amo Nowruz\" and teens could have fun with that and got interesting gifts like PS5. The main target for this campaign was getting retention from old users, generating new leads, and turning them into app users. Nowruz Holiday was one of the best times for Bazaar to launch this campaign, because people have plenty of free time to spend on Social Media.
